Quadrants
UR: ^ air, ^ Q, ^ water 
	midland/upland river in winter - warm air makes warm rain which makes warm rivers; snow is not yet contributing to discharge
	upland river in summer/fall - same reason; snow is now depleted
	
UL: ^ air, v Q, ^ water
	lowland river in summer/fall/winter - warm air holds more moisture (so there's less rain), but still makes warm rivers
	
LR: ^ air, ^ Q, v water
	midland/upland river in spring - snow/ice-melt buffering
	upland river in late summer - ice-melt buffering
	
LL: ^ air, v Q, v water
	upland river in late summer - increased moisture holding capacity (less rain) overpowers ice-melt contribution to discharge once that year's snow is gone

x=0: air and Q are uncorrelated; y is always positive under this condition
	lowland river in April - increased temperature means less rain in the lowlands, but more snowmelt
	midland river in May/June - same reason, just shifted higher upslope
	upland river in Jul/Aug/Sep - same, shifted higher
	midland/upland river in fall - increased temperature means less rain in the lowlands, but melting of early snow in some years higher up
	
y=0: air and water are uncorrelated
	any river in Dec/Feb (not Jan) - winter "wants" to achieve a state where warm air makes warm rain which makes warm rivers, 
		but it takes a while to achieve this, and only really acheives it in Jan when water temp is at its minimum and the effect of warm lowland rain is large.
		In dec/feb, this effect is only half achieved, because while there's warm lowland rain, there's also some upland rain that's colder than the rivers.
	midland/upland river in spring - snowmelt buffering: rain warming balanced by snowmelt cooling whenever there's an increase in air temp, and vice-versa
	upland river in fall - in some years, early snowfall will be melted by increases in temperature, creating a buffering effect that will dampen the positive
		air-water correlation that would be seen in other years
		
origin: air has no effect on either Q or water
	midland river in May/June - snowmelt contribution to discharge coincides with reduction in rainfall, which is still enough to counter snowmelt cooling
	midland/upland river in fall - same thing, but with early snowmelt rather than late

slope: the axis of possible states along which a river can exist with respect to the air->Q->water relationship
	more positive = greater positive relationship between water and Q
	more negative = inverse of that

centroid: the average state of the ait->Q->water relationship across rivers
