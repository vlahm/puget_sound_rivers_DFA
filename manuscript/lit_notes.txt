(Stewart et al., 2005)
streamflow timing for snowmelt dominated streams has changed toward an earlier spring over the past several decades; western US

(Fritze et al., 2011)
a set of highly vulnerable basins has experienced runoff regime shifts such that previously snowmelt dominated watersheds are now mainly rain dominated
	(dozens throughout western US)
	
Stream temperatures are affected by many factors, such as the heat exchange at the air/water interface, 
	and the temperature of the contributing hydrologic component to a stream reach

(Ficklin et al., 2012b, JAWRA)
hydrologic contributions to mountainous subbasins in California are likely to experience a shift towards earlier in the year. 
	Spring and Summer flows are likely to decrease substantially (Fig. 4), and the ratio of snowmelt to rain runoff is expected to decrease 

#### stewart etal. 2005 ####

Spring streamflow during the last five decades has shifted so that the major Aprilâ€“July streamflow peak now arrives one or more weeks earlier,
resulting in declining fractions of spring and early summer river discharge; western us
	little change in total annual discharge though
	
the average annual temperature have increased 1Â°â€“2Â°C since the 1940s over the (north) western part of North America, especially during the
winter and spring seasons (Karl et al. 1993; Lettenmaier et al. 1994; Dettinger and Cayan 1995; Vincent et al. 1999)

Winter and spring warming causes an increased fraction of the precipitation to come as rain, resulting in a reduced snowpack and an even earlier melt.

Evidence for the shift includes earlier snowmelt onsets and advances in the center of mass of the annual hydrograph, which
is called center timing (CT). Consistent with these advances are decreased spring and early summer (AMJJ) 
fractional flows and increasing fractions of annual flow occurring earlier in the water year. The months with the
largest positive fractional flow trends in the western contiguous United States are March and April, while those in Canada and Alaska are April and May.

It is generally thought that increasing greenhouse gases will cause the global hydrological cycle to intensify1, with benefits for water
availability1,6, although a possible exacerbation of hydrological extremes may counteract the benefits to some degree. However, in
regions where the land surface hydrology is dominated by winter snow accumulation and spring melt, the performance of water
management systems such as reservoirs, designed on the basis of the timing of runoff, is much more strongly related to temperature
than to precipitation changes.

despite model uncertainty, there is no indication for a seasonal shift of precipitation to the summer and autumn

Studies in various regions of the globe indicate that the stream-flow regime in snowmelt-dominated river basins is most
sensitive to wintertime increases in temperature12,13

In this review, we suggest that the simplest of changes associated with global warming (a modest increase in near-surface air temperature)
will be responsible for alterations of the hydrological cycle in snowmelt-dominated regions via seasonal shifts in stream-flow.
Without adequate water storage capacity, these changes will lead to regional water shortages.

In this study, surface snowpack typically melts by mid-July; thus, advective fluxes from upstream snowmelt may rapidly diminish as summer 

Steeper watersheds that retain more snow had negative sensitivities to air temperature during early summer (cooling with warmer air) and positive sensitivities in late summer

Regional to local scale analyses reveal that the geomorphic characteristics of watersheds (e.g., elevation, slope, area, lakes, dams, and glaciers) 
often control water temperature relationships to air temperature [e.g., Kelleher et al., 2012; Fellman et al., 2014; Luce et al., 2014]
