department of ecology ecy gis will have hax by state - this might work except that I need that piece of canada (or i could throw that point out of the set)
NLCB?

streamcat approach: sreamlines (NHD snapshot?), watershed boudaries (WDB snapshot) - mostly for making a site map, 
	(all from nhdplus website)
download streamcat layers and join to streamlines for determining statistics - could also join separately to boundaires
	and then use that to color watersheds by attributes for the map


download NHDsnapshot (probably just the local one), WBDsnapshot, and NHDPlusAttributes
in streamline file (which will be buried in NHDnapshot?):
find atttribute name of interest (might need streams and connectors, but get rid of canals etc)...
in attribute table, then go to properties > definition query > query builder > and isolate just the type im intereted in
may also just have to select by attributes like i usually do in the attributes table
if i need soil stuff, FAO is the place
if I need straight-up, no bullshit data layers, nlcd is the place - though it wont include canada
NED is 1/3 arcsecond
to get the citation for a specific dataset, dig into its metadata - won't end up citing just streamcat, for example
NED should have elevation data if i still need dems

when joining, keep only matching records
say yes to improve performance during join (i think)
check number of records for each file before joining, make sure the end result is reasonable, and export data afterward so that i have a 
separate file with the joined data
