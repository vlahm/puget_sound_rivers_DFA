watershed_data.xlsx and watershed_data_simp.csv are the same thing. the latter contains slightly less information and is set up for machine reading.
ws_covariance.R determines which landscape variables should be used in the analysis. 
These variables are explained in landscape_variable_guide.xlsx.
watershed_data_decomp_autoPhase.R is obsolete, but I left it here just in case.
