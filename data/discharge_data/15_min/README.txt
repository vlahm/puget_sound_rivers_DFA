'continuations' contains the same series as the 'daily' folder, but these are from 2008 through 2017.

stillaguamish_nf_hi.txt is of the same format, but has no historical
counterpart, so it stands alone here.

'by_year' contains data from yet another source, which pertains only 
to two of the stillaguamish sites. these data are also in 15-minute
intervals, but could ony be downloaded one year at a time.
