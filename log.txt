yes, it's cool to average the anomalies.  didn't save calculations, but just compare the mean of anomalies across
regions 3 and 4 to the calculated anomaly from their corresponding temperatures and base levels

made a new script for dfa by season
changed names of dat.z, obs.ts
currently using imputed data in the dfa, which means excluding approx 9 sites; could switch back to obs set instead of obs_imp
	nvm, switched back
ISSUE - 1978 has no winter (can fix by not omitting the two months at the beginning)

after TEMP model fitting round 2, fixed factor seasonality is the clear favorite, so i'm not varying the seasonality model
in round 3. got to determine whether to include regions as 3 and 4 separately, or the average of 3 and 4
also time to test all the possible covariates

selection process <- first determine whether seasonality (and which seasonality model) is useful
	and whether to do 3+4 or 3, 4
then find out which covariates are best
